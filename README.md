Nxt Trendz (E-commerce Clone – Amazon, Flipkart):
Description: Developed a full-stack e-commerce web application that replicates the functionality of Amazon and
Flipkart, allowing users to log in, browse, search, filter, and sort products.
Technologies used : React JS, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap for front-end development, and React Router for
dynamic routing and component management. REST API calls were used for backend communication, while local
storage was leveraged to persist user login state and manage JWT tokens for user authentication and
authorization.
• Implemented Dynamic Routing and Component Management: Designed multiple pages (Login, Product
Listing, Product Details) with seamless navigation using React Router components (Route, Switch, Link),
along with managing state and props.
• User Authentication and Authorization: Built a secure user authentication flow with username and
password validation via POST HTTP API calls. Managed user sessions by storing JWT tokens in local
storage and authorizing subsequent API requests with token-based headers.
• Search and Filter Functionality: Enhanced user experience by implementing product search, filtering, and
sorting features. Sent query parameters with API calls to dynamically filter products based on user input.
• State Management and Event Handling: Leveraged React state management, event handlers, and
controlled components for form inputs to maintain a responsive and interactive user interface.
